	// This is how we set the context profile
	// We need to do this through SDL, so that it can set up the OpenGL drawing context that matches this
	// (of course in reality we have no guarantee this will be available and should provide fallback methods if it's not!)
	// Anyway, we basically first say which version of OpenGL we want to use
	// So let's say 4.3:
	// Major version number (4):
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4);
	// Minor version number (3):
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION, 3);
	// Then we say whether we want the core profile or the compatibility profile
	// Flag options are either: SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_CORE   or   SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_COMPATIBILITY
	// We'll go for the core profile
	// This means we are using the latest version and cannot use the deprecated functions
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_CORE);



	// Now we have got SDL initialised, we are ready to create a window!
	// These are some variables to help show you what the parameters are for this function
	// You can experiment with the numbers to see what they do
	int winPosX = 100;
	int winPosY = 100;
	int winWidth = 640;
	int winHeight = 640;
	SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("My Window!!!",  // The first parameter is the window title
		winPosX, winPosY,
		winWidth, winHeight,
		SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN | SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL);
	// The last parameter lets us specify a number of options
	// Here, we tell SDL that we want the window to be shown and that it can be resized
	// You can learn more about SDL_CreateWindow here: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateWindow?highlight=%28\bCategoryVideo\b%29|%28CategoryEnum%29|%28CategoryStruct%29
	// The flags you can pass in for the last parameter are listed here: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_WindowFlags

	// The SDL_CreateWindow function returns an SDL_Window
	// This is a structure which contains all the data about our window (size, position, etc)
	// We will also need this when we want to draw things to the window
	// This is therefore quite important we don't lose it!






	// The SDL_Renderer is a structure that handles rendering
	// It will store all of SDL's internal rendering related settings
	// When we create it we tell it which SDL_Window we want it to render to
	// That renderer can only be used for this window
	// (yes, we can have multiple windows - feel free to have a play sometime)
	SDL_Renderer * renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, 0);


	// Now that the SDL renderer is created for the window, we can create an OpenGL context for it!
	// This will allow us to actually use OpenGL to draw to the window
	SDL_GLContext glcontext = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);

	// Call our initialisation function to set up GLEW and print out some GL info to console
	/*if (!InitGL())
	{
		return -1;
	}*/



	// We are going to work out how much time passes from frame to frame
	// We will use this variable to store the time at our previous frame
	// This function returns the number of milliseconds since SDL was initialised
	unsigned int lastTime = SDL_GetTicks();


	// Enable the depth test to make sure triangles in front are always in front no matter the order they are drawn
	// When you do this, don't forget to clear the depth buffer at the start of each frame - otherwise you just get an empty screen!
	glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
